About the project:

Nowadays, banks receive a lot of applications for issuance of credit cards. Many of them are rejected for many reasons, like high-loan balances,
low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individualâ€™s credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is error-prone and a time-consuming process.
Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every bank does so nowadays. In this project, 
we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.
